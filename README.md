# Basic Sanition Information System - (BaSIS)
Basic Sanitation is the lowest-cost technology ensuring hygienic excreta and sullage disposal and a clean and healthy living environment both at home and in the neighbourhood.

BaSIS is a decentralised M & E sanitation system developed to aid in the implementation of CLTS (Community-Led Total Sanitation), at both sub-national and national levels. The system is built to populate data collected from approved sources based on some sanitation indices in the form of maps, charts and tables. BaSIS, on varying levels of usage, will easily aid policy makers, governments and investors in decision-making.
As the system presents to users a more-visualised appproach to viewing sanitation data, further analysis could as well be carried out properly.
